# Churn-Risk-Mapping

##  Overview
This project analyzes customer churn patterns using telecom service data. The goal is to identify key drivers of attrition and deliver actionable insights to improve customer retention.

---

##  Objectives
- Explore churn behavior across demographics, contracts, services, and payment methods.
- Visualize patterns using Python and Seaborn for clear storytelling.
- Provide business recommendations based on data-driven insights.

---

##  Key Visualizations
- Churn by Gender, Senior Citizen, and Tenure
- Churn by Contract Type and Payment Method
- Churn by Internet Service and Add-on Services (Security, Backup, Tech Support)
- Monthly Charges vs Churn (Boxplot)

---

##  Executive Summary

- **Overall Churn Rate**: 26.5% of customers have churned.
- **Senior Citizens**: 42% churn rate vs. 23% for non-seniors.
- **Tenure**: Customers with tenure <12 months show ~50% churn; >24 months show <15%.
- **Contracts**: Month-to-month contracts have 43% churn; 2-year contracts only 3%.
